# voice-assistant-kook

Making your own voice assistant like Alexa, Siri or Jarvis (from the movie 'Ironman') is very simple using Python.  
It just requires a few libraries, such as----  
1. `speech_recognition`: Install this to recognize speech input from the microphone  
2. `pyttsx3`: Install this for playing back audio files (text-to-speech)  
Then import some more libraries according to your requirement.
  
Kook uses a few more libraries, such as----  
1. `datetime`: This inbuilt Python library allows us to work with date and time.
2. `pywhatkit`: This library has to be installed to take advantage of its amazing features. Kook uses its `playonyt` function to search various things on Youtube.  
3. `wikipedia`: This library has to be installed to search things on wikipedia.  
4. `pyjokes`: This library is installed to make kook tell jokes.  
5. `subprocess`: This libary is used for running new applications or programs through Python code.  
6. `smtplib`: This amazing library can be installed and used to send mail to any Internet machine.
