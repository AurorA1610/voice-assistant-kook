Making your own voice assistant like Alexa, Siri or Jarvis (from the movie 'Ironman') is very simple using Python.
It just requires a few libraries, such as----
    1. speech_recognition (install this to recognize speech input from the microphone)
    2. pyttsx3 (install this for playing back audio files (text-to-speech))
